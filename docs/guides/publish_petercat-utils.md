Make sure you have the latest version of PyPAâ€™s build installed:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
```

Build petercat_utils:

```bash
npm run build:pypi
```

Make sure your have the latest version of twine installed:

> Uploading distributions to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
ERROR    InvalidDistribution: Metadata is missing required fields: Name, Version.
         Make sure the distribution includes the files where those fields are
         specified, and is using a supported Metadata-Version: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2,
         2.0, 2.1, 2.2.

Once the error occurs, ensure that the Twine version is 6.0.1.
For more details, refer to the issue here: https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/15611.

```bash
pip install twine==6.0.1
```

Publish it:
```bash
npm run publish:pypi
```
